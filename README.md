fft
===

A C++ implementation of the FFT algorithm for educational purposes

Todo:
1) Comment and clean up
2) Non-recursive form
3) Better code reuse?
4) Index reordering
5) Better explanation of what is going on
6) Better test inputs
7) Better namescope stuff (ie, move some subroutines into fft.cpp, not exposed in the namespace).
8) Consider automatic figure generation etc.
9) Better input format handling
